# cam-calibration
Contains code for calibrating a camera. Also contains an example config file. Requires opencv.

To use simply run the notebook, you must then point your camera at a chessboard pattern. You will see a grid, try to get different angles. If you feel that you have enough press Q to exit the camera capture and run the rest of the notebook. It may take several minutes. You can copy the printout into the config file I have provided.
